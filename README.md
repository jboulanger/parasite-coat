# Parasite coat

Tools to analyze the fluorescence recovery of parasite coat protein from 3D timelapse microscopy image sequences. 

## Content
- Parasite_Coat_Recovery.ijm : an ImageJ macro segmenting the parasite and measuring the fluorescence recovery. It also includes the estimation of the model.
- Analyze Results.ipynb : a jupyter notebook for analyzing the output of the macro.
- data: folder with example data

## Requirements
* For running the analysis macro please install:
    - Fiji (https://fiji.sc/)
    - MorpholibJ (https://github.com/ijpb/MorphoLibJ) can be installed by activating the IJPB-plugins update site.

* Dependencies for running the notebook can be installed using:
```bash
conda create -n parasite-coat -c conda-forge python numpy scipy matplotlib jupyterlab yml pandas seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Parasite need to be selected in the original image sequence, cropped and saved as TIFF files. 
2. Save a list of the images in a csv file with the following information:
    |Filename| Start time [min]| First frame|
    |--------|-----------------|------------|
    |   .tif | 30              |      10    |
3. Open the macro in Fiji and press run, select the csv file as input and press run. The macro generates a profile.csv file for each image,
 a summary.csv file for the dataset and a config.yml file.
4. Open the notebook and set the config file to the config.yml file generated by the macro.
